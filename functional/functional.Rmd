## Functional Style Programming

<blockquote style ="margin-top:15%;">
To become significantly more reliable, code must become more transparent. In particular, nested conditions and loops must be viewed with great suspicion. Complicated control flows confuse programmers. Messy code often hides bugs.

**What is a functional programming language?**

- Simply put: a language which is centered on problem solving using functions!

- There are two common threats:

    1. A functional language has **first-class functions** which behave like any other data type. In R this means we may treat function like variables (e.g. assign them, store them in alist or pass them as arguments in other functions)
    
    2. Many functional languages require **pure** functions. These are functions which have no side-effects: they do not interfer with anything outside their scope and produce output which depends only on input.

???

Does R allow for pure functions only? No: e.g. `print()` has side-effects. Obviously all functions which return pseudo-prandom numbers are not pure functions.
---
## FAQs
    
**Is R a functional programming language?**

In view of the above (no requirement of pure functions), strictly speaking R is not a functional programming language but we may adopt a functional *style* of programming, which is what we will focus on.

**Why should I use functional style programming?**

- Functional programming is often space efficient, very comprehensible and easily adopted to new situations

- Functionals are easily analysed in isolation and thus are often straightforward to optimize and parallelise

---
## FAQs

**What does 'functional programming style' even mean?**

Itâ€™s hard to describe exactly what a functional style is, but generally we will refer to the following definition:  

<br>
<blockquote>
Functional programming style means decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a function or combination of functions.
.right[&mdash; <cite>Hadley Wickham</cite>]
</blockquote>

## FAQs

We will briefly discuss key techniques in functional R programming which are best summarized be the table below. We will focus on `purrr` functionals and applications of function factories.

## Functionals

A **functional** takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output.

```{r}
randomise <- function(f) f(rnorm(1e3))
randomise(mean)
randomise(sum)
```

More prominent examples are, e.g. `lapply()` and `integrate()`.

---
## Functionals

Functionals are often used as an alternative to loops. Not because they are inherently slow (which is common wisdom), but because loops are very flexible:

- Loops convey that an iteration is done, but not what should be done with the results.
    
- Functionals are taylored to specific tasks which immedeatly convey *why* they are being used.
    
Switching from loops to functionals doesn't necessarily mean that we must write our own functionals: the `purrr` package has functionals which are very concise in application and also fast as they are written in C.

## Functionals &mdash; `purrr::map()`

`map()` is the `purrr` version of `lapply()`.

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Producing Atomic Vectors

- There are helper functions which are more convenient if simpler data structures are required: `map_lgl()`, `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, and `map_chr()` return an atomic vector of the specified type.

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Producing Atomic Vectors

The *twiddle operator* `~` allows to use anonymous functions in a less verbose manner. It conveys that the subsequent expression is a formula.

A good rule of thumb is that if a function spans lines or uses `{...}`, we should give it a name.

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Exercises

1. `map(1:3, ~ runif(2))` is a useful pattern for generating random numbers, but `map(1:3, runif(2))` is not. Why not? Can you explain why it returns the result that it does?

2. The following code simulates the performance of a t-test for non-normal data. Extract the p-value from each test, then visualise.
    ```{r, eval=F}
    trials <- map(1:100, ~ t.test(rpois(10, 10), rpois(7, 10)))
    ```

3. Use `map()` to fit linear models to the `mtcars` dataset using the formulas stored in this list:
    ```{r, eva}
    formulas <- list(
       mpg ~ disp,
       mpg ~ disp + wt,
       mpg ~ I(1 / disp) + wt

Tired of `mtcars`? We're too... let's use `cars2018`, a dataset on fuel efficiency of real cars of today from a US Department of Energy instead! ðŸš—ðŸš—ðŸš—

We will now take a quick look at how `purrr` functions can be used to fit a regression model to subgroups of data, extract estimates and then compare the approach to base R approaches.

```{r, message=F}
cars2018 <- readr::read_csv("~/ARE/data/cars2018.csv")
by_drive <- split(cars2018, cars2018$Drive)
```

**`purrr` Style:**

```{r}
by_drive %>% 
  map(~ lm(MPG ~ Cylinders, data = .x)) %>% 
  map(coef) %>% 
  map_dbl(2)
```

## `purrr`-style Model Fitting

**`apply()`-style R**

```{r}
models <- lapply(by_drive, function(data) lm(MPG ~ Cylinders, data = data))
vapply(models, function(x) coef(x)[[2]], double(1))
```

**Pure base R**

```{r}
slopes <- double(length(by_drive))
for (i in seq_along(by_drive)) {
  model <- lm(MPG ~ Cylinders, data = by_drive[[i]])
  slopes[[i]] <- coef(model)[[2]]
}
slopes
```

]

---
## `purrr`-style Model Fitting 

- `purrr` code is most accessible as each line encapsulates a single step and the `purrr` helpers allow us to concisely describe what to do in each step.

- Moving from `purrr` to base R we see that the number of iterations decreases while each iteration becomes increasingly complicated:

  - Using `purrr` we iterate 3 times (`map()`, `map()` and `map_dbl()`)
  
  - The `apply()` version iterates twice (`lapply()` and `vapply()`)
  
  - The pure base R solution has only one `for()` loop

## Map Variants

.smaller[

There are 23 variants of `map()` in total which are easily understood as variants of the following 5 (new) functions with helpers for different input and outputs.

- Output same type as input: **`modify()`**

- Iterate over two inputs: **`map2()`**

- Iterate with an index: **`imap()`**

- Return nothing: **`walk()`**

- Iterate over any number of inputs: **`pmap()`**

<br>

|    	                   | List          |	Atomic       | Same type     | Nothing      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| One argument	         | `map()`	     | `map_*()`	   | `modify()`    | `walk()`     |
| Two arguments	         | `map2()`	     | `map2_*()`	   | `modify2()`   | `walk2()`    |
| One argument + index	 | `imap()`	     | `imap_*()`	   | `imodify()`	 | `iwalk()`    |
| N arguments	       	   | `pmap()`      | `pmap_*()`	   | `â€”`	         | `pwalk()`    |

## `purrr::modify()`

.medium[

`modify()` works on the input *components* and returns an object of the same type as the input.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: `data.frame` in / `data.frame` out

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = 6:4
)

modify(df, ~ .x * 2)
```

Note that `modify()` does not modify in-place but creates a copy which must be assigned if changing the input is required.

```{r}
df <- modify(df, ~ .x * 2)
```

`map2_dbl` varies both `xs` and `ws` as inputs to `weighted.mean()`.

## `purrr::walk()`

## `purrr::imap()`

.scroll-output[
.smaller[

We've seen that `for(x in xs)` is essentially the analog to `map()`. 

`for(i in seq_along(xs))` and `for(nm in names(xs))` are analogous to `imap()`: `imap(.x, .f)` applies `.f` to values `.x` *and* indices or names derived from `.x`.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: named column means

`imap()` is a useful helper if we want to work with values along with variable names.

## `purrr::pmap()`

`pmap()` generalises `map()` and `map2()` to `p` vectorised arguments. Thus `pmap(list(x, y), f)` is the same as `map2(x, y, f)`.

`tribble()`: create tibbles using an easier to read row-by-row layout. This is useful for small tables of data where readability is important.

## `purrr::pmap()` &mdash; Exercises

1. Explain the results of `modify(cars2018, 1)`

2. Explain how the following code transforms a data frame using functions stored in a list.
    ```{r, eval=F}
    trans <- list(
      Displacement = function(x) x * 0.0163871,
      Transmission = function(x) factor(x, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual", "CVT"))
    )
    
    nm <- names(trans)
    mtcars[nm] <- map2(trans, cars2018[nm], function(f, var) f(var))
    ```

3. Compare and contrast the `map2()` approach to this `map()` approach:
    ```{r, eval=F}
    mtcars[vars] <- map(vars, ~ trans[[.x]](cars2018[[.x]]))
    ```
    
---
## `purrr::reduce()`

Having only two main variants, the `reduce` family of functions is much smaller than the `map` family and implements a less commonly needed yet powerful concept:

`reduce()` produces a vector of length 1 from vector input by calling `f` with a pair of values at a time: `reduce(1:4, f)` gives `f(f(f(1, 2), 3), 4)`.

Consider the following list of numeric vectors `l`.

```{r}

A base R solution is rather cumbersome even for a small set of vectors.

```{r}
out <- l[[1]]
out <- intersect(out, l[[2]])
out <- intersect(out, l[[3]])
out <- intersect(out, l[[4]])
out

We could generalise the above to an arbitrary number of vectors using a loop but such operations are conveniently handled by `reduce()` which is also more efficient.

```{r}
reduce(l, intersect)
reduce(l, union)

## `purrr::accumulate()`

.smaller[

`accumulate()` is a variant of `reduce()` which returns the final and all intermediate results.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: cumulative sum

The difference between `reduce()` and `accumulate()` is best understood using a sequence of binary arithmetic operations.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
reduce(x, `+`)

vs.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
accumulate(x, `+`)
